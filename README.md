# Vue.js Projects and Examples

This repository contains a collection of Vue.js projects and examples, created for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Directory Structure

The projects are organized into subdirectories, each focusing on a specific Vue.js concept or feature. Some projects are built using Vue CLI, while others are simple HTML files with embedded Vue.js code.

## How to Use

To explore the projects:

1.  **Navigate to a project subdirectory:** Each subdirectory contains a separate project or example.
2.  **Check for a `package.json` file:**
    *   **If a `package.json` file exists:** This typically indicates a Vue CLI project.
        *   Open your terminal in that project's directory.
        *   Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
        *   Run `npm run serve` (or `yarn serve`) to start the development server.
    *   **If no `package.json` file exists:** The project is likely a single HTML file.
        *   Simply open the `.html` file in your web browser to view the example.
3.  **Consult individual project READMEs:** Some projects may have their own `README.md` files with more specific instructions.
